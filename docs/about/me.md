Industrial designer. I have developed my career in the technology and innovation area. From the development of projects in the medical field, to projects of large scale production and retail design. I have also collaborated with national and international companies.

As a methodology, I use Design Thinking. With focus on empathy and creativity, I design simple solutions on the basis of present challenges, I utilize manual and digital prototyping tools for visualization and testing.

I have an interest in fabrication, technology, and manufacturing with the creation on the basis of emotions, empathy and aesthetic
