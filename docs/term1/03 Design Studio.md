For the beginning of the design studio, we learned about the value of prototyping, different methods, and objectives of prototyping based on the First-Person Design method, where the designer immerses themselves in the environment they want to influence

As a designer, I already have experience with prototypes, but for the coming year, I would like to integrate this practice with more advanced technologies such as augmented reality or artificial intelligence
